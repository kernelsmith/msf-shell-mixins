- See what the nil changes will break in post and meterp scripts
- Add boolean? methods to accomodate, like service_exist? registry_val_exist? registry_key_exist? and alias them to present? etc
- Implement the methods that the shell version supports that the meterp version doesn't (the NOTIMP ones) -- might need Carlos' help
- Test with Java/PHP meterps
