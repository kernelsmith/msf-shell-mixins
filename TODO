- See what the nil changes will break in post and meterp scripts
	none in post so far as I can tell
- Add boolean? methods to accomodate, like service_exist? registry_val_exist? registry_key_exist? and alias them to present? etc
	reg val and key exist are done.  No aliases.  service_exist? not started yet
- Implement the methods that the shell version supports that the meterp version doesn't (the NOTIMP ones) -- might need Carlos' help
- Test with Java/PHP meterps
