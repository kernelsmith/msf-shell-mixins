This is where and post modules that require changes to work with the 'return nil on success' scheme will reside.
However all testable post modules seem to work fine as is (not too many actually use services.rb or registry.rb).
But, the ones that do use them, seem to be fine.  Didn't do extensive failure condition testing on them however.
The test modules in test/post/test exercise a lot of the failure modes however
