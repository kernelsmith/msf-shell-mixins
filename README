mixin-modules/ contain the actual mixin code
testing-scripts/ are the post modules I used for testing the mixins

for testing I:
- overwrote lib/msf/core/post/windows/[services.rb,registry.rb] with mixin-modules/*.rb
- created ~/.msf3/modules/post/windows/test/ 
- added testing-scripts/test-* to ~/.msf3/modules/post/windows/test/ 
- started msfconsole with the appropriate rc script in testing-scripts/
- established a rev shell from a win xp3 box using an exe created with /testing-scripts/make*.sh
- ran the test post mods

This stemmed from a conversation with egypt who mentioned he wanted to add modules for non-native
meterpreters to be able to interact with services and the registry etc just like native meterp can.
Basically these modules just try to execute and parse the output of appropriate command line tools
to get the same functionality.  Functions were modeled to take and return the same values as their
native counterparts (darkoperator's mixins).

Egypt is working on integrating into the post code so this shell version is automatically chosen
if the session is a shell or non-native windows meterpreter.

I established a general parser and error parser to facilitate additional table-formatted CLI tools
in the future.  Tho I've only tested with reg.exe and sc.exe.  You just pass in the raw results of
a command and it parses what it can discern into a hash using keys and vals found in the output.  
The error parser uses it too.

Darkoperator has had problems with these types of CLI tools, he's seen them bork remote shell
connections, esp with netcat.  I didn't have any issues with the shell connection dropping, but I 
only tested on WinXP3 using a rev shell & msf

I noticed a bug in the windowsservices mixin:  service['credentials'] is spelled 
service['creentials']. It's probably fixed by now, but wanted to document it here so I don't forget.

TODO: (from darkoperator) it would be nice to have a mixin to do like armitage that uses printf 
to write binary files to the target box also.

Still learning Ruby so please give feedback at will and let me know if there are other things 
that need doing.  I will keep this repo updated with any changes.
